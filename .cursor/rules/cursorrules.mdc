# Local Development Environment Setup

## Port Configuration
- Always run the development server on port 3002
- Before starting the server, ensure no process is running on port 3002

## Starting the Development Server
1. First, kill any existing process on port 3002:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :3002 | grep LISTEN | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. Use Vercel Dev to run the project:
   ```bash
   vercel dev --listen 3002
   ```

## Important Notes
- Do NOT use `npm run dev` - always use `vercel dev` for local development
- If you encounter any port conflicts, follow step 1 above to clear the port
- Make sure you have Vercel CLI installed globally (`npm i -g vercel`)
